Tequila time.. So far so good. Devilspeak was a nice change from the normal. Tequila hasn't kicked in yet. The bodies hanging from the ceiling was a nice touch, bitty they took it down. 

Next up was Mind the Child had some nice moments but the heavy breathing was a touch off putting.

  


   We are Conduit - So cool to watch Natalie on stage again. She keeps you entertained. So far they get my vote for most entertaining. Swopped to staight tequila as it's still not kicking in.

Junkyard lipstick, a all girl band coming up.. It's been awhile since I last heard them and they are now such a nice tight band. The start was a touch rocky as the singers voice wasn't 100s but was awesome by the end. The crowd would vote this one so far.. 

Beeldenstorm - never seen them before but I'm sure I've escorted the lead signer out of a nightclub before for been too drunk. Missed the start of there set tring to sort this tequila issue out. Opinion, they sound better when they sing in Afrikaans. 

It's been awhile since I've been around so much leather. I truly have missed it. Visiting the secound area, nice little crowd keeping the DJ happy. Forgot j's DJ name..

Mezzanine floor (ps) tequila kicking in... Drinking with Natalie so missed most this show but they sound cool. I've missed to much of this band but the songs I've catches are awesome. Tequila predictive texts works great. 

Philip has got a nice crowd going in secound area but it's hot as fuck.

Mind assault, waiting front of stage... The mind is blown. Passion screams from the stage when they play.

Nicci did her thing on secound area, was interesting none the less but I must chat to her.

Infantrria - I'm not 100% sure what's going on anymore. I'm gonna leave it at that for now. Will edit and photos tomorrow.
